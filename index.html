      <h1> About Me </h1>
      <p> Hi, my name is Viola Zhao and I am studying Computer Science with a focus in Linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My passion is in UI/UX design, and I hope that my coding and language knowledge will give me more insight into the kinds of front-end designs people want to see and help me to execute those ideas. I am also passionate about my family and friends, community, and art (both making it and seeing it). Although I like to keep myself busy working towards my goals, you will find me during my breaks painting at Petroglyph, snowboarding in Lake Tahoe, baking with my little sister, or binge watching my favorite TV show Terrace House. </p>
